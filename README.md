How do I use it:

We recommend starting with 3 drops of the lower strength oil twice a day. To take simply drop the cdb oil under your tongue using the pipette or the spray. This achieves the best possible absorption rates and bioavailability.

You can then increase the dosage as required on a weekly basis, to a maximum of 6 drops twice a day, until the desired results are achieved.

If you find that you’re nearing the end of the bottle and you’re already taking 6 drops twice a day but it isn’t hitting the spot, we would recommend upgrading to our regular or higher strength cbd oil.
