Between us we have 20 years experience in professional sport and have been under the surgeons knife 12 times. We have played and trained through pain and injury a lot more often than we would have liked.
We didn’t want to keep relying on prescription pain killers and anti-inflammatories to keep us on the pitch because of their negative side effects. So we began to look for other solutions… and that's when we discovered the benefits of legal cbd products. 
Our recovery and rehab routines no longer involve taking harmful prescription pills, but 100% natural and organic cbd products. 
Now we want to create the best cbd products on the market, specifically designed and inspired by our experience of the thrilling yet punishing world of sport.
We are committed to bringing you the highest grade cbd products and are proud to offer all-natural, organic and lab-tested cbd oils.
