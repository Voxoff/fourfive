To Discuss with Tyler
#####################
Once Ive added say an oil to my cart there is no option to chose another product or promoted to buy another and no menu of products on the left or right side to encourage a customer to continue shopping

The top Left menu bar should really say /MENU’ or similar and the text needs to be darker as otherwise you will have issues with people navigating the page
happy with as is for now? anyone any thoughts? I like how simple it looks



Id suggest change the colour of the BUY IT NOW button to Yellow or similar to prompt a customer to add to their cart
I quite like the idea of our yellow colour filling the box with black writing in the BUY NOW bit to make it stand out. The BUY NOW bit I am talking about is the one attached in the screen shot. thoughts? tell me to shut up if that wouldn't look good. Tyler / Guy
